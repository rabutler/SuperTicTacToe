# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

A super tic-tac-toe game, developed in R Shiny, to see if it could be done.
The game is available at XXX with instructions.

The game can also be run in an interactive R session by downloading the directory
and running `playGame()` in `playGame.R`.

Credit goes to XXX (reddit.com) for the original, at least as far as I know, 
idea for the game; to Skyler for teachging me the game; and to 4 days of not 
being able to surf and not having internet to distract me in El Paredon, 
Guatemala.
