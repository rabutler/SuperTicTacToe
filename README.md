# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

A super tic-tac-toe game, developed in R Shiny, to see if it could be done.
The game is available at XXX with instructions.

Credit to Skyler for teaching me the game; and to 4 days of not 
being able to surf and not having internet to distract me in El Paredon, 
Guatemala. I believe Skyler learned about the game from this reddit post:
